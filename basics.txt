Static Markup: HTML CSS JavaScript
API : our own or 3rd party.  JS talks to the API

what is req's JAM:
    site markup is rendered before or during deployment
    the entire code base must live on Git

    NOT JAM: code rendered at run time on server (word press, drupal, nuxt etc)

BEST PRACTICES:
    static assets, CDN hosting, atomic deploys, cache invalidation


serve entire app/website from content delivery network (GitHub pages)
auto atomic deploys 
auto cache invalidation

step 1.
# GETTING STARTED ON BASIC WEBSITE :
in terminal: 
    mkdir <folder name>
    touch index.html 
    touch style.css 
    touch README.md 

open html file, enter basic html elements, link css file 

step 2.
# Git or GitHub. make new repo

terminal:
    git init
    git add .  
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    <past in the remote source link from GitHub repo >
    git push -u origin master

step 3.
# now deploy to host. GitHub Pages. 
GitHub settings > scroll down to GitHub Pages > IF just simple static website, then select master branch otherwise select master branch/docs folder {used for static site generators}
> hit Save > scroll back down to Pages section and see a link (takes a few minutes)
